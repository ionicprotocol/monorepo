            The Ionic Protocol system and software (the “Ionic Protocol”) is an autonomous system of
            smart contracts on various blockchains that permits, among other things, transactions
            using smart contracts, and lending and borrowing of cryptocurrencies. The Ionic
            Protocol, https://midascapital.xyz (the “Interface” or “App”) — which includes text,
            images, audio, code and other materials (collectively, the &quot;Content&quot;) and all
            of the features provided. Note, however, the Ionic Protocol is an experimental prototype
            and its use involves a high degree of risk. There are numerous ways the Ionic Protocol
            could fail in an unexpected way, resulting in the total and absolute loss of funds in
            the protocol. Please read these Terms of Use (the “Terms” or “Terms of Use”) carefully
            before using the Service. By using or otherwise accessing the Service, or clicking to

          <Text textDecoration={'underline'}>12.2. Binding Arbitration</Text>

          <Text>
            If we cannot resolve the dispute through good-faith negotiations, you and we agree that
            any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally settled in binding
            arbitration, on an individual basis, in accordance with the American Arbitration
            Association&apos;s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes (accessible at
            https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf) and you and Midas Labs
            Ltd. & Midas Labs FZE LLC hereby expressly waive trial by jury and right to participate
            in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted
            by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in the county or parish in which
            you reside, or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language. The
            arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award,
            including attorneys&apos; fees when authorized by law, and the arbitral decision may be
            enforced in any court. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by
            telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on
            briefs, without oral hearings. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to
            enforce this agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys&apos; fees. If the
            arbitrator(s) or arbitration administrator would impose filing fees or other
            administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such
            fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were
            proceeding instead in a court. We will also pay additional fees or costs if required to
            do so by the arbitration administrator&apos;s rules or applicable law. Apart from the
            foregoing, each Party will be responsible for any other fees or costs, such as attorney
            fees that the Party may incur. If a court decides that any provision of this section
            12.2 is invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and the other parts of
            this section 12.2 shall still apply. In any case, the remainder of this Agreement, will
            continue to apply.

          <Text textDecoration={'underline'}>13.2. Waiver and Severability of Terms</Text>

          <Text>
            The failure of any entity to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms
            shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms
            is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties
            nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to the

            Terms remain in full force and effect.
