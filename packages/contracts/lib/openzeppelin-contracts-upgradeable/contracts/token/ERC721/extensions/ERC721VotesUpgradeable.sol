 * @dev Extension of ERC721 to support voting and delegation as implemented by {Votes}, where each individual NFT counts
 * as 1 vote unit.
 *
 * Tokens do not count as votes until they are delegated, because votes must be tracked which incurs an additional cost
 * on every transfer. Token holders can either delegate to a trusted representative who will decide how to make use of
 * the votes in governance decisions, or they can delegate to themselves to be their own representative.
 *
 * _Available since v4.5._
