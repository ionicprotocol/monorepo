Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ``` contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```\",\"events\":{\"Initialized(uint8)\":{\"details\":\"Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\"}},\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"stateVariables\":{\"_initialized\":{\"custom:oz-retyped-from\":\"bool\",\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\"},\"_initializing\":{\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":\"Initializable\"},\"evmVersion\":\"london\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"none\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[\":@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/\",\":@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/=lib/pyth-sdk-solidity/\",\":ds-test/=lib/forge-std/lib/ds-test/src/\",\":flywheel-v2/=lib/flywheel-v2/src/\",\":flywheel/=lib/flywheel-v2/src/\",\":forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/\",\":fuse-flywheel/=lib/fuse-flywheel/src/\",\":libcompound/=lib/fuse-flywheel/lib/libcompound/src/\",\":openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/\",\":openzeppelin-contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/\",\":ops/=lib/ops/contracts/\",\":pyth-sdk-solidity/=lib/pyth-sdk-solidity/\",\":solidity-bytes-utils/=lib/solidity-bytes-utils/\",\":solmate/=lib/solmate/src/\",\":weird-erc20/=lib/fuse-flywheel/lib/libcompound/lib/solmate/lib/weird-erc20/src/\"]},\"sources\":{\"lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x6c2b54ec184943843041ab77f61988b5060f6f03acbfe92cdc125f95f00891da\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://efc212a7612f6ea70f7aa1f68b9c26e7ceaa412333e23dcf66740f9d51fa689b\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmTkcTYoF14eN12FxyX2GQRc9KwdhYfjoJ3XJt1yvJWcaB\"]},\"lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/utils/AddressUpgradeable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x0a3b4afc301241e2629ad192fa02e0f8626e3cf38ab6f45342bfd7afbde16ee0\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://b189423f1102ff4487e9c59a65ec400b98cc4aeef478dac8272b482e9f5ad7de\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmdpYHrzD8wPe5DMuEiWkXiVLsTkqD7C4tbBjWwkBQwJi2\"]}},\"version\":1}","metadata":{"compiler":{"version":"0.8.10+commit.fc410830"},"language":"Solidity","output":{"abi":[{"inputs":[{"internalType":"uint8","name":"version","type":"uint8","indexed":false}],"type":"event","name":"Initialized","anonymous":false}],"devdoc":{"kind":"dev","methods":{},"version":1},"userdoc":{"kind":"user","methods":{},"version":1}},"settings":{"remappings":["@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/","@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/=lib/pyth-sdk-solidity/","ds-test/=lib/forge-std/lib/ds-test/src/","flywheel-v2/=lib/flywheel-v2/src/","flywheel/=lib/flywheel-v2/src/","forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/","fuse-flywheel/=lib/fuse-flywheel/src/","libcompound/=lib/fuse-flywheel/lib/libcompound/src/","openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/","openzeppelin-contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/","ops/=lib/ops/contracts/","pyth-sdk-solidity/=lib/pyth-sdk-solidity/","solidity-bytes-utils/=lib/solidity-bytes-utils/","solmate/=lib/solmate/src/","weird-erc20/=lib/fuse-flywheel/lib/libcompound/lib/solmate/lib/weird-erc20/src/"],"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":200},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"none"},"compilationTarget":{"lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol":"Initializable"},"evmVersion":"london","libraries":{}},"sources":{"lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol":{"keccak256":"0x6c2b54ec184943843041ab77f61988b5060f6f03acbfe92cdc125f95f00891da","urls":["bzz-raw://efc212a7612f6ea70f7aa1f68b9c26e7ceaa412333e23dcf66740f9d51fa689b","dweb:/ipfs/QmTkcTYoF14eN12FxyX2GQRc9KwdhYfjoJ3XJt1yvJWcaB"],"license":"MIT"},"lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/utils/AddressUpgradeable.sol":{"keccak256":"0x0a3b4afc301241e2629ad192fa02e0f8626e3cf38ab6f45342bfd7afbde16ee0","urls":["bzz-raw://b189423f1102ff4487e9c59a65ec400b98cc4aeef478dac8272b482e9f5ad7de","dweb:/ipfs/QmdpYHrzD8wPe5DMuEiWkXiVLsTkqD7C4tbBjWwkBQwJi2"],"license":"MIT"}},"version":1},"id":458}
